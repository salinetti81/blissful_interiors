      <h3>Meet Carolyn Salinetti</h3>

      <h2>Interior Designer from Melrose, MA</h2>

      <p>A funny thing happened to me when I stood in front of a 1940s Cape Cod style house in Melrose a little over a year ago. </p>
      <p><span>I fell in <b>love</b> with its possibilities.</span></p>
      <p>I had to look past the overgrown boxwood topiaries and the brownish-red door. I had to look under about 10 layers of paint. But it was there. <span>So much potential.</span> A vision for what could be.</p> 
      <p>Even though I&#39;ve worked as a professional interior designer for ten years, it wasn&#39;t until we bought that 1940s Cape Cod house that I focused my full attention on residential spaces.</p>
      <p>Our house was dated, but it also had the kind of charm that can only be found in homes that have been loved and lived in for a long time.</p>
      <p> Once we took a closer look at the walls and ceilings that were lacquered with high-gloss white paint, we discovered crown molding. There was a quaint phone nook in the hall, a built-in cabinet in the dining room, and original hardwood floors.</p>
      <p>Then we watched The Money Pit right after we moved in. Too soon. It&#39;s billed as a comedy, but when you&#39;ve just purchased your first fixer-upper, it&#39;s not funny. It&#39;s frightening!</p>
      <p>Yes, our roof was sagging and our 1940s kitchen cabinets were termite-ridden. Choosing what to tackle first was like triage.</p><br>
      <p>We couldn&#39;t afford a big kitchen renovation at the time, so we used Lowe&#39;s cabinets and counters for a quick and necessary update. Someday, we&#39;ll upgrade.</p>

        <!-- <div class="caption">Ironing board cabinet turned spice rack</div> -->

      <p><span>But then came the design!</span></p>
      <p>I could finally make my home everything I&#39;d always wanted a home to be. I wanted a big POP of color in the living room (after living in beige apartments for years), and fun wallpaper, and room for my grandmother&#39;s mid-century rocking chairs.</p> 
      <p>I found myself blending vintage and modern influences that would tell our story, but I was also careful to highlight, rather than hide, the charming quirky details that help tell the story of our house.</p>
      <p>That joy - the joy of the design process and the joy of living in a beautiful, character-filled (yet practically modern) home is what I want for you.</p>

      <h3>My Style & Your Style</h3>
      <p>My personal style is contemporary, yet comfortable, with a dash of mid-century modern. Think Anthropologie meets West Elm. Color pops make me happy. <br><span>And giving old houses fresh charm is my favorite thing to do.<span></p>

      <p>But just because that&#39;s my style doesn&#39;t mean it has to be yours. You, your family, and your house are unique - and the best interior design is one that helps *you* live joyfully in your home. In fact, you might just call it <span>blissful<span>.<p>
