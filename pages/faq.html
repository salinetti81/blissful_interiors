FAQ
How much does interior design cost?
You know how there’s a big difference between formica and quartz countertops? Well, that’s why prices for interior design vary - it really depends on you! For full-service design, light renovation and staging, I charge a small consultation fee with an hourly rate for design, shopping and installation. And, if I’m purchasing items for you, I will pass along my designer discount, which might mean anything from free shipping to 20% off), just to give you some added value! 

What is the difference between Interior Design and Interior Decorating?
Interior design is the art and science of structuring spaces so they support larger life goals, solve practical problems (like storage), and create opportunities for richer human interaction. Decoration is the ‘make things pretty’ part of that equation, which I also do. Think of it this way: Warm, inviting kitchens that draw friends and family together don’t happen by accident - they happen by design!

As an Interior Designer, I am qualified for high-end design, project management, remodels and decor - but my favorite projects, personally, are helping regular people with their existing spaces. If we need to remove a wall though, I’m happy to coordinate contractors and structural engineers. 

Do I have to design my whole house?
We can go one-room at a time, or pull your entire house together. That’s entirely up to you! We can even walk through your entire house so I can give you ideas for every room that you can implement yourself - or just focus on one or two spaces that need a little extra help.

How long does it take?
Depending on the scale of the project, turnaround time typically takes between 2 to 8 weeks (not counting Home Staging or Holiday Decor, which can be done much faster - but it’s wise to schedule those in advance).
