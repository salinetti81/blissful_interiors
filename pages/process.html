PROCESS

Each of my interior design services begins with me getting to know you, because design is a collaborative process. And it’s really fun.

I’ll ask you to tell me about your style and show me images of rooms or furniture pieces you love, so we can narrow down the look and feel you want to achieve.

But design isn’t just about aesthetics - it’s about function. So I will also ask you how you’re using the space so the design will support your lifestyle and make things a little easier, and a lot more organized.

If you have existing furniture, art or photos you’d like to incorporate into the design, let me know! I can incorporate them into the design so they become part of a cohesive vision.

Every step of the way, I will show you my ideas and get your feedback. There will be no surprises, and everything will feel like you.

Then, depending on the service you choose, you can purchase products I recommend and handle installation or…

I will schedule installations, coordinate painters and wallpaper-hangers, source and coordinate the delivery of furniture, and put everything together so it looks Pinterest-perfect. 

We can work together by individual rooms, or put designer-polish on your entire house.

At the end, you’ll have a home you can be proud of. It’s a blissful feeling.
