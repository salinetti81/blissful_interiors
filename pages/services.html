    <span><b>House Color Consultation</b></span>
    <p>Knowing how to put the right colors together is key to adding polish and personality to your home. But with so many color options, it can be difficult to choose - which is probably why the best-selling interior paint color is gray. I&#39;ll show you how to use scale, pattern and color in your home to create unique, inviting, personality-filled rooms that are cozy and chic. 
    </p>

    <p>In this 1-hour consultation, I will come to your home and help you decide on a color scheme that delights you - without being &#34;too much&#34; or not enough.
    </p>

    <p>This service includes a list of specific paint colors and finishes and a detailed plan for what to paint where! </p>

    <span><i>$250</i></span><br><br>

    <span><b>Home Decorating Consultation</b></span><br>

    <p>Need help with furniture layout in an awkward space? Want to do a complete walkthrough of your home to get ideas, choose a design direction, pick colors, or decide which updates to make first?</p> 

    <p>In this 2-hour consultation, I&#39;ll be your design pro bestie to bounce ideas off of, and offer pro tips on how to make your home look pretty and polished. Then I&#39;ll send you my design notes so you have a game plan to follow.</p>

    <span><i>$500</i></span><br><br>

    <span><b>One-room Redesign</b></span>

    <p>Redesigns begin with a 2-hour in-home consultation where you can tell me your ideas, I can take measurements, and we can make notes and brainstorm together. Then I will send you an estimated budget and a game plan for moving forward.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>DIY Option</b> - After our 2-hour consultation where I get a sense of how you use the space and what style you want to achieve, I will create a concept board with products, swatches and art ideas for you to approve. Once we find your style, I&#39;ll finalize the list with where you can buy each of these items and a floor plan drawing of what to put where. <span><i>I do the design, you do the heavy-lifting.</i></span></li>

      <li><b>Full Service</b> - After our 2-hour consultation, I will create a concept board with products, swatches and art ideas for you to approve. Once we&#39;ve found your style, I&#39;ll send you a to-scale floor plan drawing to help you visualize what the room will look like. Together, we can modify this to suit your style. Then, I&#39;ll coordinate painters, wallpaper-hangers and other professionals (depending on what we need) and go shopping with my designer&#39;s discount (which I&#39;ll pass along to you). Finally, I&#39;ll put everything together so it has that <span><i>designer-touch</i></span>, while still feeling like you.<br></li>
    </ul>

    <span><b>Light Renovation</b></span>
    <p>We&#39;re not moving walls here, but we might replace countertops, cabinets, tiles and appliances - and improve lighting. As with any redesign, light renovation begins with a 2-hour design consultation and moves forward with a series of concept sketches and idea boards for you to approve, and finishes for you to choose. From there, I can coordinate installation and put the finishing touches on the design.</p><br>

    <span><b>Home Staging to Sell</b></span>
    <p>Realtors know that home staging can help homes sell faster, and for more money. I&#39;ll come in and show you how to declutter your space, help you choose buyer-friendly paint colors, and use the furniture you already have to create spaces that will make buyers feel at home.</p><br>

    <span><b>Holiday Decor</b></span>
    <p>Add some extra holiday cheer to your season with a festively decorated house that&#39;s <span><i>company-ready</i></span> and Holiday Party approved. I&#39;ll come over to your house and decorate entryways, porches, mantles, stairways, Christmas trees and tablescapes so your home will impress Martha Stewart herself (or, you know, your in-laws).</p>
