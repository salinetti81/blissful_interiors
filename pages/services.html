SERVICES
The first step for each of these services is a consultation at your home where we can discuss ideas, take measurements, make notes and brainstorm together. Then I will send you an estimated budget and a game plan for moving forward.

House Color Consultation
Knowing how to put the right colors together is key to adding polish and personality to your home. But with so many color options, it can be difficult to choose - which is probably why the best-selling interior paint color is gray. I’ll show you how to use scale, pattern and color in your home to create unique, inviting, personality-filled rooms that are cozy and chic. 

In this 1-hour consultation, I will come to your home and help you decide on a color scheme that delights you - without being “too much” or not enough.

This service includes a list of specific paint colors and finishes and a detailed plan for what to paint where!

Home Decorating Consultation
Need help with furniture layout in an awkward space? Want to do a complete walkthrough of your home to get ideas, choose a design direction, pick colors, or decide which updates to make first? In this 2-hour consultation, I’ll be your design pro bestie to bounce ideas off of, and offer pro tips on how to make your home look pretty and polished. Then I’ll send you my design notes so you have a game plan to follow.

One-room Redesign
Redesigns begin with a 2-hour in-home consultation where you can tell me your ideas, I can take measurements, and we can make notes and brainstorm together. Then I will send you an estimated budget and a game plan for moving forward.

DIY Option - After our 2-hour consultation where I get a sense of how you use the space and what style you want to achieve, I will create a concept board with products, swatches and art ideas for you to approve. Once we find your style, I’ll finalize the list with where you can buy each of these items and a floor plan drawing of what to put where. I do the design, you do the heavy-lifting. 

Full Service - After our 2-hour consultation, I will create a concept board with products, swatches and art ideas for you to approve. Once we’ve found your style, I’ll send you a to-scale floor plan drawing to help you visualize what the room will look like. Together, we can modify this to suit your style. Then, I’ll coordinate painters, wallpaper-hangers and other professionals (depending on what we need) and go shopping with my designer’s discount (which I’ll pass along to you). Finally, I’ll put everything together so it has that designer-touch, while still feeling like you.

Light Renovation
We’re not moving walls here, but we might replace countertops, cabinets, tiles and appliances - and improve lighting. As with any redesign, light renovation begins with a 2-hour design consultation and moves forward with a series of concept sketches and idea boards for you to approve, and finishes for you to choose. From there, I can coordinate installation and put the finishing touches on the design.

Home Staging to Sell
Realtors know that home staging can help homes sell faster, and for more money. I’ll come in and show you how to declutter your space, help you choose buyer-friendly paint colors, and use the furniture you already have to create spaces that will make buyers feel at home.

Holiday Decor
Add some extra holiday cheer to your season with a festively decorated house that’s company-ready and Holiday Party approved. I’ll come over to your house and decorate entryways, porches, mantles, stairways, Christmas trees and tablescapes so your home will impress Martha Stewart herself (or, you know, your in-laws).
